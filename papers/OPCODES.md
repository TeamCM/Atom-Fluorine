# Atom Processor MkII: Opcodes
- HLT (0x00): Sets the halted flag to true.
- NOP (0x01): Does nothing
- LDA (0x02) \<address16>: Loads a absolute addressed value into register AC
- LDX (0x03) \<address16>: Loads a absolute addressed value into register XR
- LDY (0x04) \<address16>: Loads a absolute addressed value into register YR
- LDIA (0x05) \<number8>: Loads a immediate value into register AC
- LDIX (0x06) \<number8>: Loads a immediate value into register XR
- LDIY (0x07) \<number8>: Loads a immediate value into register YR
- STA (0x08) \<address16>: Stores a value of AC into the specified address
- STX (0x09) \<address16>: Stores a value of XR into the specified address
- STY (0x0A) \<address16>: Stores a value of YR into the specified address
- ADA (0x0B): Doubles a value of register AC or (in practice) sums AC with itself and outputs into AC and sets flags.
- ADX (0x0C): Sums AC with XR and outputs that value into AC and sets flags.
- ADY (0x0D): Sums AC with YR and outputs that value into AC and sets flags.
- SUA (0x0E): Sets AC to 0 or subtracts AC with itself into AC and outputs into AC and sets flags. NOTE: the carry flag is inverted here
- SUX (0x0F): Subtracts AC with XR and outputs into AC and sets flags. NOTE: the carry flag is inverted here
- SUY (0x10): Subtracts AC with YR and outputs into AC and sets flags. NOTE: the carry flag is inverted here
- NANA (0x11): Xors AC with 255 and outputs into AC and sets flags or (in practice) makes a NAND operation `(input1 & input2) ^ 255` with AC and AC and outputs into AC and sets flags.
- NANX (0x12): Makes a NAND operation with AC and XR and outputs into AC and sets flags.
- NANY (0x13): Makes a NAND operation with AC and YR and outputs into AC and sets flags.
- PUSHA (0x14): Push a value from AC to stack
- PUSHX (0x15): Push a value from XR to stack
- PUSHY (0x16): Push a value from YR to stack
- POPA (0x17): Pop a value from stack to AC
- POPX (0x18): Pop a value from stack to XR
- POPY (0x19): Pop a value from stack to YR
- CMA (0x1A): Sets the zero flag to true or (in practice) subtracts AC with AC and set flags.
- CMX (0x1B): Subtracts AC with XR and set flags.
- CMY (0x1C): Subtracts AC with YR and set flags.
- JMP (0x1D) \<address16>: Sets IP to the specified address
- JZ (0x1E) \<address16>: Sets IP to the specified address only if the zero flag is true (the processor still needs to read the address)
- JC (0x1F) \<address16>: Sets IP to the specified address only if the carry flag is true (the processor still needs to read the address)
- CALL (0x20) \<address16>: Reads a address, push the current IP high byte to the stack then push low byte to the stack and after that jumps to the specified address.
- RET (0x21): Pops the high byte address from the stack, then the low byte and then jumps to that address.
- INT (0x22) \<argument8>: Triggers a maskable interrupt with the specified argument. See [Extra: Interrupts](./EXTRA.md#interrupts)
- RETI (0x23) \<argument8>: Returns from a interrupt. See [Extra: Interrupts](./EXTRA.md#interrupts)
- CZF (0x24): Sets the zero flag to false
- CCF (0x25): Sets the carry flag to false
- CIF (0x26): Sets the interrupt flag to false
- SZF (0x27): Sets the zero flag to true
- SCF (0x28): Sets the carry flag to true
- SIF (0x29): Sets the interrupt flag to true
- RST (0x2A): Resets the processor to it's default state. See [Extra: Resetting the processor](./EXTRA.md#resetting)
